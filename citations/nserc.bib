In the first part, the basic theory is set up including how the various dimensions relate to each other and how they behave under Lipschitz and Holder mappings. In the second part, many examples are discussed including self-similar sets, self-affine sets, limit sets of Kleinian groups and Mandelbrot percolation. In the third part, several applications are discussed including to problems in number theory, embedding theory, probability theory and functional analysis. Several open problems are discussed at the end.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We provide estimates for the dimensions of sets in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$ which uniformly avoid finite arithmetic progressions (APs). More precisely, we say \$F\$ uniformly avoids APs of length \$k \textbackslash geq 3\$ if there is an \$\textbackslash epsilon{$>$}0\$ such that one cannot find an AP of length \$k\$ and gap length \$\textbackslash Delta{$>$}0\$ inside the \$\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash Delta\$ neighbourhood of \$F\$. Our main result is an explicit upper bound for the Assouad (and thus Hausdorff) dimension of such sets in terms of \$k\$ and \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. In the other direction, we provide examples of sets which uniformly avoid APs of a given length but still have relatively large Hausdorff dimension. We also consider higher dimensional analogues of these problems, where APs are replaced with arithmetic patches lying in a hyperplane. As a consequence, we obtain a discretized version of a ``reverse Kakeya problem:'' we show that if the dimension of a set in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ is sufficiently large, then it closely approximates APs in every direction.},
