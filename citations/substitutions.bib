  abstract = {"Quasicrystals are non-periodic solids that were discovered in 1982 by Dan Shechtman, Nobel Prize Laureate in Chemistry 2011. The underlying mathematics, known as the theory of aperiodic order, is the subject of this comprehensive multi-volume series. This first volume provides a graduate-level introduction to the many facets of this relatively new area of mathematics. Special attention is given to methods from algebra, discrete geometry and harmonic analysis, while the main focus is on topics motivated by physics and crystallography. In particular, the authors provide a systematic exposition of the mathematical theory of kinematic diffraction. Numerous illustrations and worked-out examples help the reader to bridge the gap between theory and application. The authors also point to more advanced topics to show how the theory interacts with other areas of pure and applied mathematics"--Publisher description},

  abstract = {Subshifts of deterministic substitutions are ubiquitous objects in dynamical systems and aperiodic order (the mathematical theory of quasicrystals). Two of their most striking features are that they have low complexity (zero topological entropy) and are uniquely ergodic. Random substitutions are a generalisation of deterministic substitutions where the substituted image of a letter is determined by a Markov process. In stark contrast to their deterministic counterparts, subshifts of random substitutions often have positive topological entropy, and support uncountably many ergodic measures. The underlying Markov process singles out one of the ergodic measures, called the frequency measure. Here, we develop new techniques for computing and studying the entropy of these frequency measures. As an application of our results, we obtain closed form formulas for the entropy of frequency measures for a wide range of random substitution subshifts and show that in many cases there exists a frequency measure of maximal entropy. Further, for a class of random substitution subshifts, we prove that this measure is the unique measure of maximal entropy. These subshifts do not satisfy Bowen's specification property or the weaker specification property of Climenhaga and Thompson and hence provide an interesting new class of intrinsically ergodic subshifts.},

Previous calculations of the topological entropy of such systems implicitly used this concept and established equality of topological entropy and inflation word entropy, relying on ad hoc methods. We present a unified scheme, proving that inflation word entropy and topological entropy in fact coincide. The topological entropy is approximated by a converging series of upper and lower bounds which, in many cases, lead to an analytic expression.},

  abstract = {Symbolic dynamics is a rapidly growing area of dynamical systems. Although it originated as a method to study general dynamical systems, it has found significant uses in coding for data storage and transmission as well as in linear algebra. This book is the first general textbook on symbolic dynamics and its applications to coding. It will serve as an introduction to symbolic dynamics for both mathematics and electrical engineering students. Mathematical prerequisites are relatively modest (mainly linear algebra at the undergraduate level) especially for the first half of the book. Topics are carefully developed and motivated with many examples. There are over 500 exercises to test the reader's understanding. The last chapter contains a survey of more advanced topics, and there is a comprehensive bibliography.},

For primitive random substitutions on two letters whose second eigenvalue is greater than one in modulus, we identify a simple, computable criterion which is equivalent to topological mixing of the associated subshift. This generalises previous results on deterministic substitutions. In the case of recognisable, irreducible Pisot random substitutions, we show that the associated subshift is not topologically mixing. Without recognisability, we rely on more specialised methods for excluding mixing and we apply these methods to show that the random Fibonacci substitution subshift is not topologically mixing.},

We find some simple necessary criteria for primitive, compatible random substitutions to admit periodic points in their subshifts.

A method is outlined for enumerating periodic points of any specified length in a random substitution subshift.},
