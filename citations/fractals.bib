Let \$I\_M(P)\$ denote the relative entropy rate. Then \$n\textbackslash\^\{-1\}\textbackslash log p(x\_0,..., x\_\{n-1\})\textbackslash to I\_M(P)\$ a.s. \$(P)\$. We present an elementary proof of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem and the preceding generalization, obviating the need to verify integrability conditions and also covering the case \$I\_M(P)=\textbackslash infty\$. A sandwich argument reduces the proof to direct applications of the ergodic theorem.}

  abstract = {Several important conjectures in Fractal Geometry can be summarised as follows: If the dimension of a self-similar measure in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$ does not equal its expected value, then the underlying iterated function system contains an exact overlap. In recent years significant progress has been made towards these conjectures. Hochman proved that if the Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar measure in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$ does not equal its expected value, then there are cylinders which are super-exponentially close at all small scales. Several years later, Shmerkin proved an analogous statement for the \$L\^q\$ dimension of self-similar measures in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$. With these statements in mind, it is natural to wonder whether there exist iterated function systems that do not contain exact overlaps, yet there are cylinders which are super-exponentially close at all small scales. In this paper we show that such iterated function systems do exist. In fact we prove much more. We prove that for any sequence \$(\textbackslash epsilon\_n)\_\{n=1\}\^\{\textbackslash infty\}\$ of positive real numbers, there exists an iterated function system \$\textbackslash\{\textbackslash phi\_i\textbackslash\}\_\{i\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathcal\{I\}\}\$ that does not contain exact overlaps and \$\$\textbackslash min\textbackslash left\textbackslash\{|\textbackslash phi\_\{\textbackslash mathbf\{a\}\}(0)-\textbackslash phi\_\{\textbackslash mathbf\{b\}\}(0)|: \textbackslash mathbf\{a\},\textbackslash mathbf\{b\}\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathcal\{I\}\^n,\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathbf\{a\}\textbackslash neq \textbackslash mathbf\{b\},\textbackslash, r\_\{\textbackslash mathbf\{a\}\}=r\_\{\textbackslash mathbf\{b\}\}\textbackslash right\textbackslash\}\textbackslash leq \textbackslash epsilon\_n\$\$ for all \$n\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb\{N\}.\$},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a new approach for studying overlapping iterated function systems. This approach is inspired by a famous result due to Khintchine from Diophantine approximation. This result shows that for a family of limsup sets, their Lebesgue measure is determined by the convergence or divergence of naturally occurring volume sums. For many parameterised families of overlapping iterated function systems, we prove that a typical member will exhibit similar Khintchine like behaviour. Families of iterated function systems our results apply to include those arising from Bernoulli convolutions, the \$\textbackslash\{0,1,3\textbackslash\}\$ problem, and affine contractions with varying translation parameter. As a by-product of our analysis we obtain new proofs of well known results due to Solomyak on the absolute continuity of Bernoulli convolutions, and when the attractor in the \$\textbackslash\{0,1,3\textbackslash\}\$ problem has positive Lebesgue measure. For each \$t\textbackslash in [0,1]\$ we let \$\textbackslash Phi\_t\$ be the iterated function system given by \$\$\textbackslash Phi\_\{t\}:=\textbackslash Big\textbackslash\{\textbackslash phi\_1(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x\}\{2\},\textbackslash phi\_2(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x+1\}\{2\},\textbackslash phi\_3(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x+t\}\{2\},\textbackslash phi\_\{4\}(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x+1+t\}\{2\}\textbackslash Big\textbackslash\}.\$\$ We include a detailed study of this family. We prove that either \$\textbackslash Phi\_t\$ contains an exact overlap, or we observe Khintchine like behaviour. Our analysis of this family shows that by studying the metric properties of limsup sets, we can distinguish between the overlapping behaviour of iterated function systems in a way that is not available to us by simply studying properties of self-similar measures. Last of all, we introduce a property of an iterated function system that we call being consistently separated with respect to a measure. We prove that this property implies that the pushforward of the measure is absolutely continuous. We include several explicit examples of consistently separated iterated function systems.},

We also extend the theory from Euclidean space to a wider class of metric spaces. We investigate relationships between the \$\textbackslash Phi\$-intermediate dimensions and other notions of dimension, and study many analytic and geometric properties of the dimensions. We prove continuity-like results which improve similar results for the intermediate dimensions and give a sharp general lower bound for the intermediate dimensions that is positive for all \$\textbackslash theta \textbackslash in (0,1]\$ for sets with positive box dimension. We prove H\textbackslash "older distortion estimates which imply bi-Lipschitz stability for the \$\textbackslash Phi\$-intermediate dimensions. We prove a mass distribution principle and Frostman type lemma, and use these to study dimensions of product sets, and to show that the lower versions of the dimensions, unlike the the upper versions, are not finitely stable. We show that for any compact subset of an appropriate space, these dimensions can be used to `recover the interpolation' between the Hausdorff and box dimensions of sets for which the intermediate dimensions are discontinuous at \$\textbackslash theta=0\$, thus providing more refined geometric information about such sets.},

We go on to use this dimensional information to obtain bounds for the H\textbackslash "older regularity of maps that can deform one spiral into another, generalising the 'winding problem' of when spirals are bi-Lipschitz equivalent to a line segment. A novel feature is the use of fractional Brownian motion and dimension profiles to bound the H\textbackslash "older exponents.},

Our primary focus is on the intermediate dimensions: a family of dimensions depending on a parameter \$\textbackslash theta \textbackslash in [0,1]\$ which interpolate between the Hausdorff and box dimensions. Our main results are in the case when all the contractions are conformal. Under a natural separation condition we prove that the intermediate dimensions of the limit set are the maximum of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set and the intermediate dimensions of the set of fixed points of the contractions. This builds on work of Mauldin and Urba\textbackslash 'nski concerning the Hausdorff and upper box dimension. We give several (often counter-intuitive) applications of our work to dimensions of projections, fractional Brownian images, and general H\textbackslash "older images. These applications apply to well-studied examples such as sets of numbers which have real or complex continued fraction expansions with restricted entries. We also obtain several results without assuming conformality or any separation conditions. We prove general upper bounds for the Hausdorff, box and intermediate dimensions of infinitely generated attractors in terms of a topological pressure function. We also show that the limit set of a 'generic' infinite iterated function system has box and intermediate dimensions equal to the ambient spatial dimension, where 'generic' can refer to any one of (i) full measure; (ii) prevalent; or (iii) comeagre.},

In particular, the self-affine Bedford-McMullen carpets are a natural case for investigation, but until now only very rough bounds for their intermediate dimensions have been found. In this paper, we determine a precise formula for the intermediate dimensions \$\textbackslash dim\_\{\textbackslash, \textbackslash theta\}\textbackslash Lambda\$ of any Bedford-McMullen carpet \$\textbackslash Lambda\$ for the whole spectrum of \$\textbackslash theta \textbackslash in [0,1]\$, in terms of a certain large deviations rate function. The intermediate dimensions exist and are strictly increasing in \$\textbackslash theta\$, and the function \$\textbackslash theta\textbackslash mapsto \textbackslash dim\_\{\textbackslash, \textbackslash theta\}\textbackslash Lambda\$ exhibits interesting features not witnessed on any previous example, such as having countably many phase transitions, between which it is analytic and strictly concave. We make an unexpected connection to multifractal analysis by showing that two carpets with non-uniform vertical fibres have equal intermediate dimensions if and only if the Hausdorff multifractal spectra of the uniform Bernoulli measures on the two carpets are equal. Since intermediate dimensions are bi-Lipschitz invariant, this shows that the equality of these multifractal spectra is a necessary condition for two such carpets to be Lipschitz equivalent.},

Moreover, in case of full shift and under the assumption that the potentials depending only on the first coordinate, we show that our result is applicable for regular weights, like M\textbackslash "obius sequence.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the intermediate dimensions, a spectrum of dimensions that interpolate between the Hausdorff and box dimensions. Potential-theoretic methods are used to produce dimension bounds for images of sets under H\"older maps and certain stochastic processes. We apply this to compute the almost-sure value of the dimension of Borel sets under index-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ fractional Brownian motion in terms of dimension profiles defined using capacities. As a corollary, this establishes continuity of the profiles for Borel sets and allows us to obtain an explicit condition showing how the Hausdorff dimension of a set may influence the typical box dimension of H\"older images such as projections. The methods used propose a general strategy for related problems; dimensional information about a set may be learned from analysing particular fractional Brownian images of that set. To conclude, we obtain bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of exceptional sets, with respect to intermediate dimensions, in the setting of projections.},

We introduce a new technique for constructing and understanding examples based on combinatorial estimates for the exponential growth of certain split binomial sums. Using this approach we disprove a theorem of Falconer and Miao from 2007 and a conjecture of Miao from 2008 concerning a closed form expression for the generalised dimensions of generic self-affine measures. We also answer a question of Fraser from 2016 in the negative by proving that a certain natural closed form expression does not generally give the               L                                q                              -spectrum.

In contrast to previous work on the dimension theory of self-affine sets, we assume that the sets satisfy certain separation conditions on the projection to the principal axis, but otherwise have arbitrary overlaps in the plane. We introduce and study regularity properties of a certain symbolic non-autonomous iterated function system corresponding to "symbolic slices" of the self-affine set. We then establish dimensional formulas for the self-affine sets in terms of the dimension of the projection along with the maximal dimension of slices orthogonal to the projection. Our results are new even in the case when the self-affine set satisfies the strong separation condition: in fact, as an application, we show that self-affine sets satisfying the strong separation condition can have distinct Assouad and quasi-Assouad dimensions, answering a question of the first named author.},

Our main result is an explicit upper bound for the Assouad (and thus Hausdorff) dimension of such sets in terms of \$k\$ and \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. In the other direction, we provide examples of sets which uniformly avoid APs of a given length but still have relatively large Hausdorff dimension. We also consider higher dimensional analogues of these problems, where APs are replaced with arithmetic patches lying in a hyperplane. As a consequence, we obtain a discretized version of a ``reverse Kakeya problem:'' we show that if the dimension of a set in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ is sufficiently large, then it closely approximates APs in every direction.}

Previous work has revealed that the (related) Assouad dimension is not sufficiently sensitive to distinguish between subtle changes in the random model, since it tends to be almost surely `as large as possible' (a deterministic quantity). This has been verified in conformal and non-conformal settings. In the conformal setting, the Assouad spectrum and quasi-Assouad dimension behave rather differently, tending to almost surely coincide with the upper box dimension. Here we investigate the non-conformal setting and find that the Assouad spectrum and quasi-Assouad dimension generally do not coincide with the box dimension or Assouad dimension. We provide examples highlighting the subtle differences between these notions. Our proofs combine deterministic covering techniques with suitably adapted Chernoff estimates and Borel\textendash Cantelli-type arguments.},

  abstract = {By juxtaposing ideas from fractal geometry and dynamical systems, Hillel Furstenberg proposed a series of conjectures in the late 1960's that explore the relationship between digit expansions with respect to multiplicatively independent bases. In this work, we introduce analogues of some of the notions and results surrounding Furstenberg's work in the discrete setting of the integers. In particular, we define a new class of fractal sets of integers that parallels the notion of \$\textbackslash times r\$-invariant sets on the 1-torus, and we investigate the additive independence between these fractal sets when they are structured with respect to different bases. We obtain - an integer analogue of a result of Furstenberg regarding the classification of all sets that are simultaneously \$\textbackslash times 2\$ and \$\textbackslash times 3\$ invariant; - an integer analogue of a result of Lindenstrauss-Meiri-Peres on iterated sumsets of \$\textbackslash times r\$-invariant sets; - an integer analogue of Hochman and Shmerkin's solution to Furstenberg's sumset conjecture regarding the dimension of the sumset \$X+Y\$ of a \$\textbackslash times r\$-invariant set \$X\$ and a \$\textbackslash times s\$-invariant set \$Y\$. To obtain the latter, we provide a quantitative strengthening of a theorem of Hochman and Shmerkin which provides a lower bound on the dimension of \$\textbackslash lambda X + \textbackslash eta Y\$ uniformly in the scaling-parameters \$\textbackslash lambda\$ and \$\textbackslash eta\$ at every finite scale. Our methods yield a new combinatorial proof of the theorem of Hochman and Shmerkin that avoids the machinery of local entropy averages and CP-processes.},

Finite type is a property weaker than the open set condition, but stronger than the weak open set condition. Examples include Bernoulli convolutions with contraction factor the inverse of a Pisot number and self-similar measures associated with \$m\$-fold sums of Cantor sets with ratio of dissection \$1/R\$ for integer \$R\textbackslash leq m\$. We introduce a combinatorial notion called a loop class and prove that the set of attainable local dimensions of the measure at points in a positive loop class is a closed interval. We prove that the local dimensions at the periodic points in the loop class are dense and give a simple formula for those local dimensions. These self-similar measures have a distinguished positive loop class called the essential class. The set of points in the essential class has full Lebesgue measure in the support of the measure and is often all but the two endpoints of the support. Thus many, but not all, measures of finite type have at most one isolated point in their set of local dimensions. We give examples of Bernoulli convolutions whose sets of attainable local dimensions consist of an interval together with an isolated point. As well, we give an example of a measure of finite type that has exactly two distinct local dimensions.},

  abstract = {Consider a finite sequence of linear contractions \$S\_j(x)=\textbackslash rho x+d\$ and probabilities \$p\_j{$>$}0\$ with \$\textbackslash sum p\_j=1\$. We are interested in the self-similar measure \$\textbackslash mu=\textbackslash sum p\_j\textbackslash mu\textbackslash circ S\_j\^\{-1\}\$, of finite type. In this paper we study the multi-fractal analysis of such measures, extending the theory to measures arising from non-regular probabilities and whose support is not necessarily an interval. Under some mild technical assumptions, we prove that there exists a subset of \$\textbackslash operatorname\{supp\}\textbackslash mu\$ of full \$\textbackslash mu\$ and Hausdorff measure, called the truly essential class, for which the set of (upper or lower) local dimensions is a closed interval. Within the truly essential class we show that there exists a point with local dimension exactly equal to the dimension of the support. We give an example where the set of local dimensions is a two element set, with all the elements of the truly essential class giving the same local dimension. We give general criteria for these measures to be absolutely continuous with respect to the associated Hausdorff measure of their support, and we show that the dimension of the support can be computed using only information about the essential class. To conclude, we present a detailed study of three examples. First, we show that the set of local dimensions of the biased Bernoulli convolution with contraction ratio the inverse of a simple Pisot number always admits an isolated point. We give a precise description of the essential class of a generalized Cantor set of finite type, and show that the \$k\$-th convolution of the associated Cantor measure has local dimension at \$x\textbackslash in(0,1)\$ tending to 1 as \$k\$: tends to infinity. Lastly, we show that within a maximal loop class that is not truly essential, the set of upper local dimensions need not be an interval. This is in contrast to the case for finite type measures with regular probabilities and full interval support.}

  abstract = {It is known that the heuristic principle, referred to as the multifractal formalism, need not hold for self-similar measures with overlap, such as the 3-fold convolution of the Cantor measure and certain Bernoulli convolutions. In this paper we study an important function in the multifractaltheory, the \$L\^q\$-spectrum, \$\textbackslash tau(q)\$, for measures of finite type, a class of self-similar measures that includes these examples. Corresponding to each measure, we introduce finitely many variants on the \$L\^q\$-spectrum which arise naturally fromthe finite type structure and are often easier to understand than \$\textbackslash tau\$. We show that \$\textbackslash tau\$ is always bounded by the minimum of these variants and is equal tothe minimum variant for \$q\textbackslash geq 0\$.  This particular variant coincides with the \$L\^q\$-spectrum of the measure \$\textbackslash mu\$ restricted to appropriate subsets of its support. If the IFS satisfies particular structural properties, which do hold for the above examples, then \${$\tau\$$} is shown to be the minimum of these variants for all \$q\$. Undercertain assumptions on the local dimensions of \$\textbackslash mu\$, we prove that the minimum variant for \$q\textbackslash ll 0\$ coincides with the straight line having slope equal to themaximum local dimension of \$\textbackslash mu\$.  Again, this is the case with the examples above.  More generally, bounds are given for \$\textbackslash tau\$ and its variants in terms of notions closely related to the local dimensions of \$\textbackslash mu\$.},

  abstract = {We study self-similar sets and measures on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$. Assuming that the defining iterated function system \$\textbackslash Phi\$ does not preserve a proper affine subspace, we show that one of the following holds: (1) the dimension is equal to the trivial bound (the minimum of \$d\$ and the similarity dimension \$s\$); (2) for all large \$n\$ there are \$n\$-fold compositions of maps from \$\textbackslash Phi\$ which are super-exponentially close in \$n\$; (3) there is a non-trivial linear subspace of \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$ that is preserved by the linearization of \$\textbackslash Phi\$ and whose translates typically meet the set or measure in full dimension. In particular, when the linearization of \$\textbackslash Phi\$ acts irreducibly on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$, either the dimension is equal to \$\textbackslash min\textbackslash\{s,d\textbackslash\}\$ or there are super-exponentially close \$n\$-fold compositions. We give a number of applications to algebraic systems, parametrized systems, and to some classical examples. The main ingredient in the proof is an inverse theorem for the entropy growth of convolutions of measures on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$, and the growth of entropy for the convolution of a measure on the orthogonal group with a measure on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$. More generally, this part of the paper applies to smooth actions of Lie groups on manifolds.},

Under a mild technical assumption, we establish that the set of attainable local dimensions is a finite union of (possibly singleton) compact intervals. The number of intervals is bounded above by the number of non-trivial maximal strongly connected components of a finite directed graph construction depending only on the governing iterated function system. We also explain how our results allow computations of the sets of local dimensions in many explicit cases. This contextualises and generalises a vast amount of prior work on sets of local dimensions for self-similar measures satisfying the WSC.}

A suitable separation condition is introduced under which a variational formula is proved for the \$L\^q\$ spectrum of any self-affine measure defined on a sponge for all \$q\textbackslash in\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$. Apart from some special cases, even the existence of their box dimension was not proved before. Under certain conditions the formula has a closed form which in general is an upper bound. The Frostman and box dimension of these measures is also determined. The approach unifies several existing results and extends them to arbitrary dimensions. The key ingredient is the introduction of a novel pressure function which aims to capture the growth rate of box counting quantities on sponges. We show that this pressure satisfies a variational principle which resembles the Ledrappier--Young formula for Hausdorff dimension.},

We introduce the notion of `equi-homogeneity' of a set, which requires a uniformity in the cardinality of local covers at all length-scales and at all points, and we show that a large class of homogeneous Moran sets have this property. We prove that the Assouad and box-counting dimensions coincide for sets that have equal upper and lower box-counting dimensions provided that the set `attains' these dimensions (analogous to `s-sets' when considering the Hausdorff dimension), and the set is equi-homogeneous. Using this fact we show that for any {$\alpha$} {$\in$} (0, 1) and any {$\beta$}, {$\gamma$} {$\in$} (0, 1) such that {$\beta$} + {$\gamma$} {$\geqslant$} 1 we can construct two generalised Cantor sets \$C\$ and \$D\$ such that \$\textbackslash operatorname\{dim\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{B\} C=\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash beta\$, \$\textbackslash operatorname\{dim\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{B\}\} D= \textbackslash alpha\textbackslash gamma\$, and \$\textbackslash operatorname\{dim\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{A\}\} C= \textbackslash operatorname\{dim\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{A\}\}  D= \textbackslash operatorname\{dim\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{A\}\} (C \texttimes{} D) = \textbackslash operatorname\{dim\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{B\}\} (C \texttimes{} D) = \textbackslash alpha\$.},

In this paper we give a surprising characterization of the closed convex sets which can occur as closure of the sharp \$L\^p\$ improving region of \$M\_E\$ for some \$E\$. This region depends on the Minkowski dimension of \$E\$, but also other properties of the fractal geometry such the Assouad spectrum of \$E\$ and subsets of \$E\$. A key ingredient is an essentially sharp result on \$M\_E\$ for a class of sets called (quasi-)Assouad regular which is new in two dimensions.},

This generalizes the net interval construction of Feng from the equicontractive finite type case. When the measure satisfies the weak separation condition, we prove that this directed graph has a unique attractor. This allows us to verify the multifractal formalism for restrictions of \$\textbackslash mu\$ to certain compact subsets of \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$, determined by the directed graph. When the measure satisfies the generalized finite type condition with respect to an open interval, the directed graph is finite and we prove that if the multifractal formalism fails at some \$q\textbackslash in\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$, there must be a cycle with no vertices in the attractor. As a direct application, we verify the complete multifractal formalism for an uncountable family of IFSs with exact overlaps and without logarithmically commensurable contraction ratios.},

The derived notion of the Assouad spectrum fixes relative scales by a scaling function to obtain interpolation behaviour between the quasi-Assouad and the box-counting dimensions. While the quasi-Assouad and Assouad dimensions often coincide, they generally differ in random constructions. In this paper we consider a generalised Assouad spectrum that interpolates between the quasi-Assouad and the Assouad dimension. For common models of random fractal sets, we obtain a dichotomy of its behaviour by finding a threshold function where the quasi-Assouad behaviour transitions to the Assouad dimension. This threshold can be considered a phase transition, and we compute the threshold for the Gromov boundary of Galton\textendash Watson trees and one-variable random self-similar and self-affine constructions. We describe how the stochastically self-similar model can be derived from the Galton\textendash Watson tree result.},

The finiteness of extremal points is examined a priori from the IFS parameters, revealing some cases when the convex hull problem is solvable. Former results are detailed from the literature, and two new methods are introduced and crystallized for practical applicability \textemdash{} one more general, the other more efficient. Focal periodicity in the address of extremal points emerges as the central idea.}
