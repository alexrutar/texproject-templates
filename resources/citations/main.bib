  abstract = {Motivated by a classical question of Mahler (1984), Levesley, Salp, and Velani (2007) showed that the Hausdorff measure of the set of points in the middle-third Cantor set which are \$\textbackslash psi\$-well-approximable by triadic rationals satisfies a zero-full dichotomy. More precisely, the Hausdorff measure of this set is either zero or full according to, respectively, the convergence or divergence of a certain sum which is dependent on \$\textbackslash psi\$. In this article, we prove an analogue of this result, obtaining a zero-full dichotomy for Hausdorff measure, in the setting of more general self-conformal sets with an appropriate adapted notion of approximation. Unlike in the work of Levesley, Salp, and Velani, we show that we are unable to apply the Mass Transference Principle due to Beresnevich and Velani (2006) in our setting. Instead, our proof relies on recasting the problem in the language of symbolic dynamics and appealing to several concepts from thermodynamic formalism, eventually enabling us to use an analogue of the mass distribution principle. In addition to demonstrating how our main result naturally extends the work of Levesley, Salp, and Velani, and complements some recent work of Baker (2018), we apply our main result to obtain a Jarn\textbackslash '\{\textbackslash i\}k type statement for the Hausdorff measure of the set of badly approximable numbers which are "well-approximable" in some sense by fixed quadratic irrationals. This relies on the fact that the set of badly approximable numbers with partial quotients bounded above by a fixed \$M \textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb\{N\}\$ forms a self-conformal, but not self-similar, set. Hence this is a novel application of our main result which does not follow directly from previous results in this direction.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a new approach for studying overlapping iterated function systems. This approach is inspired by a famous result due to Khintchine from Diophantine approximation. This result shows that for a family of limsup sets, their Lebesgue measure is determined by the convergence or divergence of naturally occurring volume sums. For many parameterised families of overlapping iterated function systems, we prove that a typical member will exhibit similar Khintchine like behaviour. Families of iterated function systems our results apply to include those arising from Bernoulli convolutions, the \$\textbackslash\{0,1,3\textbackslash\}\$ problem, and affine contractions with varying translation parameter. As a by-product of our analysis we obtain new proofs of well known results due to Solomyak on the absolute continuity of Bernoulli convolutions, and when the attractor in the \$\textbackslash\{0,1,3\textbackslash\}\$ problem has positive Lebesgue measure. For each \$t\textbackslash in [0,1]\$ we let \$\textbackslash Phi\_t\$ be the iterated function system given by \$\$\textbackslash Phi\_\{t\}:=\textbackslash Big\textbackslash\{\textbackslash phi\_1(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x\}\{2\},\textbackslash phi\_2(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x+1\}\{2\},\textbackslash phi\_3(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x+t\}\{2\},\textbackslash phi\_\{4\}(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x+1+t\}\{2\}\textbackslash Big\textbackslash\}.\$\$ We include a detailed study of this family. We prove that either \$\textbackslash Phi\_t\$ contains an exact overlap, or we observe Khintchine like behaviour. Our analysis of this family shows that by studying the metric properties of limsup sets, we can distinguish between the overlapping behaviour of iterated function systems in a way that is not available to us by simply studying properties of self-similar measures. Last of all, we introduce a property of an iterated function system that we call being consistently separated with respect to a measure. We prove that this property implies that the pushforward of the measure is absolutely continuous. We include several explicit examples of consistently separated iterated function systems.},

            We provide estimates for the dimensions of sets in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$ which uniformly avoid finite arithmetic progressions (APs). More precisely, we say \$F\$ uniformly avoids APs of length \$k \textbackslash geq 3\$ if there is an \$\textbackslash epsilon{$>$}0\$ such that one cannot find an AP of length \$k\$ and gap length \$\textbackslash Delta{$>$}0\$ inside the \$\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash Delta\$ neighbourhood of \$F\$. Our main result is an explicit upper bound for the Assouad (and thus Hausdorff) dimension of such sets in terms of \$k\$ and \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. In the other direction, we provide examples of sets which uniformly avoid APs of a given length but still have relatively large Hausdorff dimension. We also consider higher dimensional analogues of these problems, where APs are replaced with arithmetic patches lying in a hyperplane. As a consequence, we obtain a discretized version of a “reverse Kakeya problem:” we show that if the dimension of a set in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ is sufficiently large, then it closely approximates APs in every direction.},

  abstract = {Consider a finite sequence of linear contractions \$S\_j(x)=\textbackslash rho x+d\$ and probabilities \$p\_j{$>$}0\$ with \$\textbackslash sum p\_j=1\$. We are interested in the self-similar measure \$\textbackslash mu=\textbackslash sum p\_j\textbackslash mu\textbackslash circ S\_j\^\{-1\}\$, of finite type. In this paper we study the multi-fractal analysis of such measures, extending the theory to measures arising from non-regular probabilities and whose support is not necessarily an interval.

Under some mild technical assumptions, we prove that there exists a subset of \$\textbackslash operatorname\{supp\}\textbackslash mu\$ of full \$\textbackslash mu\$ and Hausdorff measure, called the truly essential class, for which the set of (upper or lower) local dimensions is a closed interval. Within the truly essential class we show that there exists a point with local dimension exactly equal to the dimension of the support. We give an example where the set of local dimensions is a two element set, with all the elements of the truly essential class giving the same local dimension. We give general criteria for these measures to be absolutely continuous with respect to the associated Hausdorff measure of their support, and we show that the dimension of the support can be computed using only information about the essential class.

To conclude, we present a detailed study of three examples. First, we show that the set of local dimensions of the biased Bernoulli convolution with contraction ratio the inverse of a simple Pisot number always admits an isolated point. We give a precise description of the essential class of a generalized Cantor set of finite type, and show that the \$k\$-th convolution of the associated Cantor measure has local dimension at \$x\textbackslash in(0,1)\$ tending to 1 as \$k\$: tends to infinity. Lastly, we show that within a maximal loop class that is not truly essential, the set of upper local dimensions need not be an interval. This is in contrast to the case for finite type measures with regular probabilities and full interval support.},

  abstract = {It is known that the heuristic principle, referred to as the multifractal formalism, need not hold for self-similar measures with overlap, such as the 3-fold convolution of the Cantor measure and certain Bernoulli convolutions. In this paper we study an important function in the multifractaltheory, the \$L\^q\$-spectrum, \$\textbackslash tau(q)\$, for measures of finite type, a class of self-similar measures that includes these examples. Corresponding to each measure, we introduce finitely many variants on the \$L\^q\$-spectrum which arise naturally fromthe finite type structure and are often easier to understand than \$\textbackslash tau\$. We show that \$\textbackslash tau\$ is always bounded by the minimum of these variants and is equal tothe minimum variant for \$q\textbackslash geq 0\$.  This particular variant coincides with the \$L\^q\$-spectrum of the measure \$\textbackslash mu\$ restricted to appropriate subsets of its support. If the IFS satisfies particular structural properties, which do hold for the above examples, then \$τ\$ is shown to be the minimum of these variants for all \$q\$. Undercertain assumptions on the local dimensions of \$\textbackslash mu\$, we prove that the minimum variant for \$q\textbackslash ll 0\$ coincides with the straight line having slope equal to themaximum local dimension of \$\textbackslash mu\$.  Again, this is the case with the examples above.  More generally, bounds are given for \$\textbackslash tau\$ and its variants in terms of notions closely related to the local dimensions of \$\textbackslash mu\$.},

  abstract = {We study self-similar sets and measures on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$. Assuming that the defining iterated function system \$\textbackslash Phi\$ does not preserve a proper affine subspace, we show that one of the following holds: (1) the dimension is equal to the trivial bound (the minimum of \$d\$ and the similarity dimension \$s\$); (2) for all large \$n\$ there are \$n\$-fold compositions of maps from \$\textbackslash Phi\$ which are super-exponentially close in \$n\$; (3) there is a non-trivial linear subspace of \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$ that is preserved by the linearization of \$\textbackslash Phi\$ and whose translates typically meet the set or measure in full dimension. In particular, when the linearization of \$\textbackslash Phi\$ acts irreducibly on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$, either the dimension is equal to \$\textbackslash min\textbackslash\{s,d\textbackslash\}\$ or there are super-exponentially close \$n\$-fold compositions. We give a number of applications to algebraic systems, parametrized systems, and to some classical examples. The main ingredient in the proof is an inverse theorem for the entropy growth of convolutions of measures on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$, and the growth of entropy for the convolution of a measure on the orthogonal group with a measure on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$. More generally, this part of the paper applies to smooth actions of Lie groups on manifolds.},

They are used to sharpen some recent results of Tn- a Strichartz concerning the asymptotic behavior of Ha(T; p) as T--* o\% where p is the self-similar measure as above. In the development some results concerning the open set condition are also obtained.},

Former results are detailed from the literature, and two new methods are introduced and crystallized for practical applicability — one more general, the other more efficient.
