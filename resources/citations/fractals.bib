  abstract = {Motivated by a classical question of Mahler (1984), Levesley, Salp, and Velani (2007) showed that the Hausdorff measure of the set of points in the middle-third Cantor set which are \$\textbackslash psi\$-well-approximable by triadic rationals satisfies a zero-full dichotomy. More precisely, the Hausdorff measure of this set is either zero or full according to, respectively, the convergence or divergence of a certain sum which is dependent on \$\textbackslash psi\$. In this article, we prove an analogue of this result, obtaining a zero-full dichotomy for Hausdorff measure, in the setting of more general self-conformal sets with an appropriate adapted notion of approximation. Unlike in the work of Levesley, Salp, and Velani, we show that we are unable to apply the Mass Transference Principle due to Beresnevich and Velani (2006) in our setting. Instead, our proof relies on recasting the problem in the language of symbolic dynamics and appealing to several concepts from thermodynamic formalism, eventually enabling us to use an analogue of the mass distribution principle. In addition to demonstrating how our main result naturally extends the work of Levesley, Salp, and Velani, and complements some recent work of Baker (2018), we apply our main result to obtain a Jarn\textbackslash '\{\textbackslash i\}k type statement for the Hausdorff measure of the set of badly approximable numbers which are "well-approximable" in some sense by fixed quadratic irrationals. This relies on the fact that the set of badly approximable numbers with partial quotients bounded above by a fixed \$M \textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb\{N\}\$ forms a self-conformal, but not self-similar, set. Hence this is a novel application of our main result which does not follow directly from previous results in this direction.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a new approach for studying overlapping iterated function systems. This approach is inspired by a famous result due to Khintchine from Diophantine approximation. This result shows that for a family of limsup sets, their Lebesgue measure is determined by the convergence or divergence of naturally occurring volume sums. For many parameterised families of overlapping iterated function systems, we prove that a typical member will exhibit similar Khintchine like behaviour. Families of iterated function systems our results apply to include those arising from Bernoulli convolutions, the \$\textbackslash\{0,1,3\textbackslash\}\$ problem, and affine contractions with varying translation parameter. As a by-product of our analysis we obtain new proofs of well known results due to Solomyak on the absolute continuity of Bernoulli convolutions, and when the attractor in the \$\textbackslash\{0,1,3\textbackslash\}\$ problem has positive Lebesgue measure. For each \$t\textbackslash in [0,1]\$ we let \$\textbackslash Phi\_t\$ be the iterated function system given by \$\$\textbackslash Phi\_\{t\}:=\textbackslash Big\textbackslash\{\textbackslash phi\_1(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x\}\{2\},\textbackslash phi\_2(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x+1\}\{2\},\textbackslash phi\_3(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x+t\}\{2\},\textbackslash phi\_\{4\}(x)=\textbackslash frac\{x+1+t\}\{2\}\textbackslash Big\textbackslash\}.\$\$ We include a detailed study of this family. We prove that either \$\textbackslash Phi\_t\$ contains an exact overlap, or we observe Khintchine like behaviour. Our analysis of this family shows that by studying the metric properties of limsup sets, we can distinguish between the overlapping behaviour of iterated function systems in a way that is not available to us by simply studying properties of self-similar measures. Last of all, we introduce a property of an iterated function system that we call being consistently separated with respect to a measure. We prove that this property implies that the pushforward of the measure is absolutely continuous. We include several explicit examples of consistently separated iterated function systems.},

  abstract = {Several important conjectures in Fractal Geometry can be summarised as follows: If the dimension of a self-similar measure in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$ does not equal its expected value, then the underlying iterated function system contains an exact overlap. In recent years significant progress has been made towards these conjectures. Hochman proved that if the Hausdorff dimension of a self-similar measure in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$ does not equal its expected value, then there are cylinders which are super-exponentially close at all small scales. Several years later, Shmerkin proved an analogous statement for the \$L\^q\$ dimension of self-similar measures in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$. With these statements in mind, it is natural to wonder whether there exist iterated function systems that do not contain exact overlaps, yet there are cylinders which are super-exponentially close at all small scales. In this paper we show that such iterated function systems do exist. In fact we prove much more. We prove that for any sequence \$(\textbackslash epsilon\_n)\_\{n=1\}\^\{\textbackslash infty\}\$ of positive real numbers, there exists an iterated function system \$\textbackslash\{\textbackslash phi\_i\textbackslash\}\_\{i\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathcal\{I\}\}\$ that does not contain exact overlaps and \$\$\textbackslash min\textbackslash left\textbackslash\{|\textbackslash phi\_\{\textbackslash mathbf\{a\}\}(0)-\textbackslash phi\_\{\textbackslash mathbf\{b\}\}(0)|: \textbackslash mathbf\{a\},\textbackslash mathbf\{b\}\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathcal\{I\}\^n,\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathbf\{a\}\textbackslash neq \textbackslash mathbf\{b\},\textbackslash, r\_\{\textbackslash mathbf\{a\}\}=r\_\{\textbackslash mathbf\{b\}\}\textbackslash right\textbackslash\}\textbackslash leq \textbackslash epsilon\_n\$\$ for all \$n\textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb\{N\}.\$},

In the first part, the basic theory is set up including how the various dimensions relate to each other and how they behave under Lipschitz and Holder mappings. In the second part, many examples are discussed including self-similar sets, self-affine sets, limit sets of Kleinian groups and Mandelbrot percolation. In the third part, several applications are discussed including to problems in number theory, embedding theory, probability theory and functional analysis. Several open problems are discussed at the end.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We provide estimates for the dimensions of sets in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$ which uniformly avoid finite arithmetic progressions (APs). More precisely, we say \$F\$ uniformly avoids APs of length \$k \textbackslash geq 3\$ if there is an \$\textbackslash epsilon{$>$}0\$ such that one cannot find an AP of length \$k\$ and gap length \$\textbackslash Delta{$>$}0\$ inside the \$\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash Delta\$ neighbourhood of \$F\$. Our main result is an explicit upper bound for the Assouad (and thus Hausdorff) dimension of such sets in terms of \$k\$ and \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. In the other direction, we provide examples of sets which uniformly avoid APs of a given length but still have relatively large Hausdorff dimension. We also consider higher dimensional analogues of these problems, where APs are replaced with arithmetic patches lying in a hyperplane. As a consequence, we obtain a discretized version of a “reverse Kakeya problem:” we show that if the dimension of a set in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ is sufficiently large, then it closely approximates APs in every direction.},

  abstract = {By juxtaposing ideas from fractal geometry and dynamical systems, Hillel Furstenberg proposed a series of conjectures in the late 1960's that explore the relationship between digit expansions with respect to multiplicatively independent bases. In this work, we introduce analogues of some of the notions and results surrounding Furstenberg's work in the discrete setting of the integers. In particular, we define a new class of fractal sets of integers that parallels the notion of \$\textbackslash times r\$-invariant sets on the 1-torus, and we investigate the additive independence between these fractal sets when they are structured with respect to different bases. We obtain - an integer analogue of a result of Furstenberg regarding the classification of all sets that are simultaneously \$\textbackslash times 2\$ and \$\textbackslash times 3\$ invariant; - an integer analogue of a result of Lindenstrauss-Meiri-Peres on iterated sumsets of \$\textbackslash times r\$-invariant sets; - an integer analogue of Hochman and Shmerkin's solution to Furstenberg's sumset conjecture regarding the dimension of the sumset \$X+Y\$ of a \$\textbackslash times r\$-invariant set \$X\$ and a \$\textbackslash times s\$-invariant set \$Y\$. To obtain the latter, we provide a quantitative strengthening of a theorem of Hochman and Shmerkin which provides a lower bound on the dimension of \$\textbackslash lambda X + \textbackslash eta Y\$ uniformly in the scaling-parameters \$\textbackslash lambda\$ and \$\textbackslash eta\$ at every finite scale. Our methods yield a new combinatorial proof of the theorem of Hochman and Shmerkin that avoids the machinery of local entropy averages and CP-processes.},

Finite type is a property weaker than the open set condition, but stronger than the weak open set condition. Examples include Bernoulli convolutions with contraction factor the inverse of a Pisot number and self-similar measures associated with \$m\$-fold sums of Cantor sets with ratio of dissection \$1/R\$ for integer \$R\textbackslash leq m\$. We introduce a combinatorial notion called a loop class and prove that the set of attainable local dimensions of the measure at points in a positive loop class is a closed interval. We prove that the local dimensions at the periodic points in the loop class are dense and give a simple formula for those local dimensions. These self-similar measures have a distinguished positive loop class called the essential class. The set of points in the essential class has full Lebesgue measure in the support of the measure and is often all but the two endpoints of the support. Thus many, but not all, measures of finite type have at most one isolated point in their set of local dimensions. We give examples of Bernoulli convolutions whose sets of attainable local dimensions consist of an interval together with an isolated point. As well, we give an example of a measure of finite type that has exactly two distinct local dimensions.},

  abstract = {Consider a finite sequence of linear contractions \$S\_j(x)=\textbackslash rho x+d\$ and probabilities \$p\_j{$>$}0\$ with \$\textbackslash sum p\_j=1\$. We are interested in the self-similar measure \$\textbackslash mu=\textbackslash sum p\_j\textbackslash mu\textbackslash circ S\_j\^\{-1\}\$, of finite type. In this paper we study the multi-fractal analysis of such measures, extending the theory to measures arising from non-regular probabilities and whose support is not necessarily an interval. Under some mild technical assumptions, we prove that there exists a subset of \$\textbackslash operatorname\{supp\}\textbackslash mu\$ of full \$\textbackslash mu\$ and Hausdorff measure, called the truly essential class, for which the set of (upper or lower) local dimensions is a closed interval. Within the truly essential class we show that there exists a point with local dimension exactly equal to the dimension of the support. We give an example where the set of local dimensions is a two element set, with all the elements of the truly essential class giving the same local dimension. We give general criteria for these measures to be absolutely continuous with respect to the associated Hausdorff measure of their support, and we show that the dimension of the support can be computed using only information about the essential class. To conclude, we present a detailed study of three examples. First, we show that the set of local dimensions of the biased Bernoulli convolution with contraction ratio the inverse of a simple Pisot number always admits an isolated point. We give a precise description of the essential class of a generalized Cantor set of finite type, and show that the \$k\$-th convolution of the associated Cantor measure has local dimension at \$x\textbackslash in(0,1)\$ tending to 1 as \$k\$: tends to infinity. Lastly, we show that within a maximal loop class that is not truly essential, the set of upper local dimensions need not be an interval. This is in contrast to the case for finite type measures with regular probabilities and full interval support.},

  abstract = {It is known that the heuristic principle, referred to as the multifractal formalism, need not hold for self-similar measures with overlap, such as the 3-fold convolution of the Cantor measure and certain Bernoulli convolutions. In this paper we study an important function in the multifractaltheory, the \$L\^q\$-spectrum, \$\textbackslash tau(q)\$, for measures of finite type, a class of self-similar measures that includes these examples. Corresponding to each measure, we introduce finitely many variants on the \$L\^q\$-spectrum which arise naturally fromthe finite type structure and are often easier to understand than \$\textbackslash tau\$. We show that \$\textbackslash tau\$ is always bounded by the minimum of these variants and is equal tothe minimum variant for \$q\textbackslash geq 0\$.  This particular variant coincides with the \$L\^q\$-spectrum of the measure \$\textbackslash mu\$ restricted to appropriate subsets of its support. If the IFS satisfies particular structural properties, which do hold for the above examples, then \$τ\$ is shown to be the minimum of these variants for all \$q\$. Undercertain assumptions on the local dimensions of \$\textbackslash mu\$, we prove that the minimum variant for \$q\textbackslash ll 0\$ coincides with the straight line having slope equal to themaximum local dimension of \$\textbackslash mu\$.  Again, this is the case with the examples above.  More generally, bounds are given for \$\textbackslash tau\$ and its variants in terms of notions closely related to the local dimensions of \$\textbackslash mu\$.},

  abstract = {We study self-similar sets and measures on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$. Assuming that the defining iterated function system \$\textbackslash Phi\$ does not preserve a proper affine subspace, we show that one of the following holds: (1) the dimension is equal to the trivial bound (the minimum of \$d\$ and the similarity dimension \$s\$); (2) for all large \$n\$ there are \$n\$-fold compositions of maps from \$\textbackslash Phi\$ which are super-exponentially close in \$n\$; (3) there is a non-trivial linear subspace of \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$ that is preserved by the linearization of \$\textbackslash Phi\$ and whose translates typically meet the set or measure in full dimension. In particular, when the linearization of \$\textbackslash Phi\$ acts irreducibly on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$, either the dimension is equal to \$\textbackslash min\textbackslash\{s,d\textbackslash\}\$ or there are super-exponentially close \$n\$-fold compositions. We give a number of applications to algebraic systems, parametrized systems, and to some classical examples. The main ingredient in the proof is an inverse theorem for the entropy growth of convolutions of measures on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$, and the growth of entropy for the convolution of a measure on the orthogonal group with a measure on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{d\}\$.

  abstract = {For any self-similar measure \$\textbackslash mu\$ in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$, we show that the distribution of \$\textbackslash mu\$ is controlled by products of non-negative matrices governed by a finite or countable graph depending only on the IFS. This generalizes the net interval construction of Feng from the equicontractive finite type case. When the measure satisfies the weak separation condition, we prove that this directed graph has a unique attractor. This allows us to verify the multifractal formalism for restrictions of \$\textbackslash mu\$ to certain compact subsets of \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$, determined by the directed graph. When the measure satisfies the generalized finite type condition with respect to an open interval, the directed graph is finite and we prove that if the multifractal formalism fails for any \$q\textbackslash in\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$, there must be a cycle with no vertices in the attractor. As a direct application, we verify the complete multifractal formalism for an uncountable family of IFSs with overlaps and without logarithmically commensurable contraction ratios.},

Various methods exist that approximate it, but our aim is its exact determination. The finiteness of extremal points is examined a priori from the IFS parameters, revealing some cases when the convex hull problem is solvable. Former results are detailed from the literature, and two new methods are introduced and crystallized for practical applicability — one more general, the other more efficient. Focal periodicity in the address of extremal points emerges as the central idea.},
